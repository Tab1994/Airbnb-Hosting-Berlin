# Airbnb-Hosting-Berlin
A look into Airbnb hosting from September 2022. 

As a student studying and living in Berlin, I discovered first hand how hard it was to find housing. I took this project as an opportunity to see how Airbnb might be impacting the housing crisis in Berlin. 

For my analysis I have used the Berlin data from Inside Berlin from September 15, 2022. 
The data set can be found below: http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/

I began exploring the dataset to see what stories the data was telling me. In my exploration I found that Berlin has some of the toughest vacation rental laws, specifically because of their housing crisis. 

If there are such strict laws in place, how and who are running a majority of Airbnb's within the city? 

I set out to answer the following questions: 
- Which neighborhood has the least expensive Airbnb?
- Which neighborhood has the most expensive Airbnb?
- What neighborhoods are the Airbnbs located in?
- Which hosts have the most total listings?
- How many hosts have more than 1 Airbnb listing?
- What is the average availability based on the number of hosts' listings?
- How many hosts have licenses and how many don't?

I decided to clean, explore, and visualize the data completely in JupyterLab. To further see my exploration please read through my Airbnb_Berlin.ipynd file. 

I have also included my presentation of the data and view point though my Airbnb_hosting_Berlin_final.pptx.
